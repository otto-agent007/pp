# In Progress

## Controlled rebuild

- CR00 is `done` (PR [#146](https://github.com/otto-agent007/pp/pull/146),
  merge `8f1e6cc4d1ea56a360e77c8ed36ec2fe8c315df2`). The recovery PRs
  [#147](https://github.com/otto-agent007/pp/pull/147) and
  [#149](https://github.com/otto-agent007/pp/pull/149) are merged. CR08, CR16,
  and CR17 are superseded into CR09, CR15, and CR18.
- PR [#168](https://github.com/otto-agent007/pp/pull/168) re-sequenced the
  graph so the platform chain (CR10, CR11, CR12, CR13, CR14, CR15) runs
  before the CR01-CR09 architecture refactor.
- CR10 (Node 24.20.0), CR11 (pnpm 12.3.4), CR12 (Next.js 16.3.4), and CR13
  (Expo SDK 54.0.37) are `done`; details are in `tasks/done.md`.
- **The controlled rebuild's platform chain is closed.** CR10 (Node 24.20.0),
  CR11 (pnpm 12.3.4), CR12 (Next.js 16.3.4), CR13 (Expo SDK 54.0.37), CR14 (Expo
  SDK 55.0.31) and CR15 (Expo SDK 57.0.20) are all `done`; details are in
  `tasks/done.md`.
- CR01 (executable architecture foundation) is `done`; its summary and the
  story of the stale #148 it replaced are in `tasks/done.md`.
  `pnpm architecture:check` now guards package responsibilities and dependency
  direction on every run.
- CR02 (bounded-context shared types) is `running` on
  `codex/rebuild-cr02-types-contexts-v1`, draft PR
  [#186](https://github.com/otto-agent007/pp/pull/186), awaiting controller
  merge approval. It splits `packages/types`' single 1370-line `index.ts` into
  twenty context modules and keeps the root entry as an explicit re-export
  barrel, so all 174 consumer import sites resolve unchanged. Every declaration
  moved byte-identical and the package still declares no runtime value.
  `packages/types/publicSurface.test.ts` is its first test and freezes the
  175-name public surface.
- CR03-CR09 follow and each need their own controller promotion decision. They
  are the first slices in this sequence to change application code, so
  `pnpm test` becomes load-bearing again rather than the formality it was
  through the Expo hops, and `pnpm architecture:check` holds their dependency
  directions honest. Two debt exceptions expire inside them: `api-client-domain-manifest`
  in CR05 and `domain-to-api-client` in CR09.
- Known follow-up left by CR02: `packages/types` exposes no subpath entry
  points, so a consumer cannot address a context directly as
  `@pest-patrol/types/jobs`. No consumer wants to today, and supporting it
  means satisfying `tsc`, Next.js, Metro and vitest resolution. Revisit only
  when a consumer needs it.
- A slice now needs only controller merge approval to land. Three control-plane
  changes removed the rest: PR
  [#178](https://github.com/otto-agent007/pp/pull/178) (no reconciliation PR and
  no red default branch), PR
  [#180](https://github.com/otto-agent007/pp/pull/180) (`tooling/` typechecked
  and linted), and PR [#182](https://github.com/otto-agent007/pp/pull/182)
  (source tags published automatically on merge).
- Known follow-up carried out of CR12: 16 `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` v7
  findings in `apps/web` (13 `set-state-in-effect`, 2 `purity`, 1 `use-memo`)
  are tracked warnings, not fixes. Clearing them changes component behaviour
  and belongs in its own change.
- Known follow-ups surfaced by CR13's prebuilds, both pre-existing and
  behavioural, so tracked rather than changed inside a version migration:
  `apps/mobile/app.json` declares no `ios.bundleIdentifier` or
  `android.package`, so prebuild derives the placeholders
  `com.anonymous.pest-patrol-os` and `com.anonymous.pestpatrolos`; real
  identifiers are a product and provider decision needed before any store or
  EAS build. And `userInterfaceStyle: "automatic"` is inert on Android without
  `expo-system-ui`, which is not installed — adding it would switch dark mode
  on.

## Repository security refresh (2026-09-05 to 2026-09-06)

- Dependency, CI, Dependabot, and code-audit fix PRs
  [#152](https://github.com/otto-agent007/pp/pull/152) and
  [#158](https://github.com/otto-agent007/pp/pull/158) through
  [#166](https://github.com/otto-agent007/pp/pull/166) are merged; details live
  in `tasks/done.md`. Hygiene PR
  [#167](https://github.com/otto-agent007/pp/pull/167) is merged.
- Deferred follow-ups: enforcing CSP after collecting reports from
  `/api/csp-report`; Supabase leaked-password protection (paid plan);
  `onlyBuiltDependencies` now that pnpm 12 has landed; an operator-assisted
  preview smoke run of the new RLS policies and triggers; adding the CodeQL
  check to the `main` ruleset (needs an operator).
